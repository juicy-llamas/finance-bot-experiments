So first, I have to decide what I'm going to be investing in....

I probably won't start with amazon products, as that requires other types of things like shipping / buying and I have no real money to spend there. If other types of trading don't become profitable, I could venture there once my job starts earning more money.

I will probably start with trying to predict stocks, as 1: there are far more resources available for that, 2: it's completely digital, 3: I actually have a fucking broker's account now, 4: even though there *are* individuals and organizations (arguably a lot of them) that do use machine learning to do what I am trying, in particular NLP, the way I'm doing it (I believe) is unique enough to stand on it's own, and 5: Just because a *small* percent of the market uses machine learning doesn't mean it's saturated. There is *plenty* of opportunity to cash in if my model is halfway decent, at least I hope.

There are, of course, other digital options, the biggest one being crypto. Crypto is actually a lot like stock trading except it's more unstable and sources talking about it are arguably less reliable (since not many people actually know how crypto works as a digital currency, and even fewer people actually understand how the market for crypto works). This would probably be second on the list, as it is very accessible since I registered with WeBull (I could also easily get a coinbase account or something), but this is not my priority.

There are more established (digital) markets other than stocks, like foreign exchange with currencies (so that's what people mean when they say forex. Why can't people just say foreign exchange market?), valuable commodities (I believe there are sites that allow you to buy stake in stuff like gold), etc. 

------------

So for stocks (and options / anything that trades with companies), I'll be looking at these things:
	- Raw stats
		- Price of the stock, obviously.
		- Revenue of the company.
		- Net income.
		- Profit margin.
		- Total equity of the company such as assets.
		- Total amount of debt the company has taken on.
		- Debt to Equity
		- Quarterly Debt / Quarterly Earnings
		- More, depends on if I need them because these can get somewhat redundant.
	- Market
		- Market trading volume, or at least the most accurate representation I can find.
		- Company market share
		- Is this market new or old?
			- Is there anything possibly superseding this market? Ex. Clean energy superseds gas (kinda)
			- If the market is shrinking, how rapidly is it shrinking?
		- Market events
			- Wars / disasters?
			- Countries banning?
			- Other news about product?
			- Duration on the event? Or permanent?
			- Is this correlated with stock price?
	- Consumers
		- Consumer target demographic (is this a demographic that is proftiable?)
		- demographic / market fit (if this company targets x consumer, do others in the same market do the same?)
		- Consumer feedback on product, if available.
		-
	- INSIDE BUYING, a somewhat niche but important metric
		- Buying or selling? Who? How much?
	- CORPORATE BONDS
		- stuff

AND HOW SHALT WE GET SAID STATS?
	- I can scrape the 'raw stats' from TIKR possibly, if I login with credentials
	-

Objectives:
	1. Form an all-encompassing list of companies
		- how???????????
		- find one initially
